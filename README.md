# Vaction App

## Description
The Neon-Vacation-Log app allows the user to document vacations that they have experienced. The user will be able to create a vacation module where they will give it a name and they will be able to type paragraphs describing their trip. Once a vacation module is created the user will be able to add destinations to that vacation module.
